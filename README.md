To complete this homeowrk I refactored the given index.html and style.css files to improve the code
I made sure application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure, update to make sure all links function properly, and made comments to to css file.
The application should deploy with no errors.
Application resembles the mockup provided.
The repository is uploaded properly to github, and has multiple commit messages. The repo contains a readme file and link to deployed application. (I wasn't sure what to take a screenshot of)
